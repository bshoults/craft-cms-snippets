# craft-cms-snippets
Snippets that I use daily for Craft CMS that solve popular patterns.

## Requirements
While not required, it's helpful to be able to import/export fields and field groups. I use the FieldManger plugin for this (https://github.com/engram-design/FieldManager). I've provided a file for import in each folder.

## Setup
First, you'll need to install the above plugin, then import the fields. You'll need to create any upload directories it requires.

Each snippet is categorized and each has it's own README. I didn't comment the code to the nth degree as these are for my own personal usage and I don't need extensive documentation in the code (I know!). However, each snippet is pretty simple and I will explain what's going on in the README for that snippet.
